# solar-radiation-forecasting
Forecast the amount of horizontal solar radiation reaching the ground at a particular location over the globe (1960-2014).
### Description 
This project is aimed to analyse and forecast the amount of horizontal solar radiation reaching the
ground at a particular location over the globe, between 1960-2014. 
The result will give best 2 years ahead forecasts in terms of MASE for the solar radiation series by
using the time series regression methods (distributed lag models (dLagM package)), dynamic linear
models (dynlm package), and exponential smoothing and corresponding state space models.
